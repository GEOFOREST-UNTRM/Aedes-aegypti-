CURRENT AND FUTURE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE Aedes aegypti IN PERU BASED ON TOPOCLIMATIC ANALISYS AND CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS

The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the vector for dengue fever, a febrile illness that has escalated into an epidemic across numerous South American countries, notably Peru, resulting in fatalities across all age groups; despite these consequences, the current and projected distribution of Aedes aegypti amidst climate change scenarios remains undetermined. Expanding on the preceding findings, our study employed bioclimatic and topographic variables to model both present and future distribution of the Ae. aegypti mosquito using the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). The results indicate that 10.23 % (132,053.96 km2) and 23.65 % (305,253.82 km2) of the surface area of Peru possesses areas with high and moderate distribution probabilities, respectively; predominantly located in the departments of San Mart√≠n, Piura, Loreto, Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas and Cusco. Moreover, based on projected future climate scenarios, it is anticipated that areas with a high probability of Ae. aegypti distribution will undergo an expansion; specifically, the extent of these areas is estimated to increase by 4.47% and 2.99% by the years 2070 and 2100 respectively in the SSP 245 of the model HadGEM-GC31-LL. Given the increasing dengue epidemic in Peru in recent years, our study seeks to identify tools for effectively addressing this pressing public health concern; consequently, this research serves as a foundational framework for assessing areas with the highest likelihood of Ae. aegypti distribution in response to projected climate change in the second half of the 21st century.
